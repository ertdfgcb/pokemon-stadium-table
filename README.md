This will display an advanced table with all the pokemon from pokemon stadium for the n64. It includes their moves, types, and stats. I built it to help rank the pokemon in that game by different metrics, search for pokemon with particular moves/types/stats, and just generally find the best team to beat my friends. Built with react and react-table.
